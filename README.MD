## Welcome To Boxy!

Boxy is a project I have worked on for my creative web module as a student studying creative computing at Bath Spa. 
Boxy is a website with a physical box attached. It is built around the idea that people who find the box will scan the QR code on boxy and will fill out a post form. We can document boxys journey on the website!
